# Squash the Creeps

A simple 3D where character can move and jump to squash the creeps, built in Godot 4. This project was created as a hands-on learning experience to understand the fundamentals of game development with the Godot engine.

## About This Project

This game was built by following the "Your first 3D game" step-by-step tutorial that is on Godot docs. It served as an excellent introduction to key concepts in Godot.
- Engine: Godot 4.5
- Tutorial: [Your first 3D game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_3d_game/index.html)

## What I Learned

Through this project, I gained experience with:
- Work with 3D coordinates with a jumping mechanic.
- Use kinematic bodies to move 3D characters and detect when and how they collide.
- Use physics layers and a group to detect interactions with specific entities.
- Code basic procedural gameplay by instancing monsters at regular time intervals.
- Design a movement animation and change its speed at runtime.
- Draw a user interface on a 3D game.
